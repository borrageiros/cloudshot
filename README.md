# CloudShot (work in progress)

CloudShot is a nimble and efficient script engineered for Windows, designed for capturing and handling screenshots with ease.

This tool empowers you to select a specific section of your screen, perform quick edits, and then offers you the following possibilities:

 - Copy the screenshot directly to your clipboard for immediate use.
 - Upload the screenshot to the cloud via SCP on a private server, making it suitable for platforms like Oracle, Amazon, or Google VPS.
 - Save the screenshot locally on your device for future reference.
